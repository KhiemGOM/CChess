# Chess
A console chess game made with C++
Just open it up in any console.
I used MinGW to compile it but I think any compiler should also work.
For the input, input the x (in letter), y coordinate (in number) of the starting square then the x, y coordinate of the target square. 
I might work on the standard notation input but that's too complicated so...
Used some C magic console thing for color and clear console so it might bug but it's not my code fault.
